Blog project made in Java.

App is a realisation of simple blog application.
User must create account in order to publicate posts.
Account must be enabled via activation link sent to given email address.
Posts may have group of authors, comments and tags.
User may edit or delete owned comments/posts.
There is one administrator account that is allowed to edit or delete every comment and post on site.
API is also included in project.
App does not look well visually, since I wasn't doing much javascript back then, also it was a project for college, and front-end wasn't evaluated.
